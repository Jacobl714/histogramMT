# histogramMT

This program computes a histogram for a function f of a text (sequence of bytes) as quickly as possible.  It takes two arguments. First, the name of a file to read and second, an upper bound on the maximum number of threads you can use.  Within this repository, I have included E.coli, which can be used to test this program.
